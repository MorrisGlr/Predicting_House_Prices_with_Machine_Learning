# Predicting_House_Prices_with_Machine_Learning
My iPython notebook visualizes more than 20 thousand housing data points from Seattle, WA and builds prediction models via multiple linear regression. In other words, a housing price prediction model was built using multiple house features such as square footage, zip code, year build, lot size, and more.

I built these models using tools from Graphlab Create for Python.
